# Chromatic/Prism Estate Audit — Fit for the Harness

**Date:** 2026-06-02 · **Harness:** `chromatic-harness-v2` (Visual Control Plane scaffold) · **Manifest:** [`estate.repos.json`](./estate.repos.json)

The harness is a portable control-plane scaffold *installed into* estate repos
(`scripts/install_visual_control_plane.py --target <repo>`). For it to manage the
estate reliably, the estate must have **one home, uniform branches, and a
machine-readable membership list**. This audit establishes that.

## Inventory
- **38 repos** across two identities: `kas1987` (32) and `Poly-Chromatic` org (6).
- The org repo `Poly-Chromatic/poly-chromatic` is the designated **governance parent**
  (governance, specs, ChromaticTrees) — but most estate repos live under personal `kas1987`.
- `~/.claude/governance/auto-mode-scope.yaml` defined the estate as only 5 federation
  roots; the other 33 repos had **no membership marker**. `estate.repos.json` fixes this.

## Decisions (2026-06-02)
1. **Consolidate the estate under the `Poly-Chromatic` org.** Personal `kas1987` keeps
   only published OSS (`9router`, `claude-octopus`, `claude-powerline`, `dmx`), local
   tooling (`claude-config`, `claude-skills`), and standalone products (`The-Veil`).
2. **Keep the harness PUBLIC** as a shareable scaffold — harden instead of hide.
3. **Canonical default branch = `main`** for every estate repo.

## Done in this change
- ✅ Created `main` on `chromatic-harness-v2` from the de-facto trunk
  (`session/chromatic-harness-v2-initial`, which already contained merged PR #203) and
  set it as the remote **default branch**. (Previously the default was a throwaway session branch.)
- ✅ Activated the existing pre-commit secret gate (`git_hooks/pre-commit` →
  `scan_for_secrets.py --staged`) via `core.hooksPath=git_hooks`. Closes the wiring gap
  behind **OBS-009**. CI already runs the blocking secret scan; commit-time was the gap.
- ✅ Added the machine-readable estate manifest + schema (this directory).

## High-priority follow-ups (outward-facing — require approval)
| Action | Why | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Fix `poly-chromatic` default branch `feat/chromatic-harness-sprint-01` → `main` | It's the **governance root** and has the same anti-pattern the harness just had | Low, reversible |
| Move estate-member repos to `Poly-Chromatic` (see manifest `target_home`) | One governed home for the harness to manage | Breaks old URLs (GitHub redirects); preserves issues/stars |
| Delete `Master_CCC` (1.79 GB archived), `Chromatic_Audit` (empty), `JOB`, `kas1987/prism-autonomy-harness` (archived dup) | Dead weight / duplicates | **Irreversible** |
| Fold `Command-Center`→`chromatic-command-center`, verify `Image-Org` vs `Image-Prism` | Resolve duplicate pairs | Medium |
| Prune ~70 stale branches on the harness (`chore/j2r0-*`, merged `clean/*`) | Branch sprawl | Low (delete merged only) |

## Branch-name normalization needed (`Main`/`Master`/feature → `main`)
`Poly-Chromatic/poly-chromatic` (feature branch), `Poly-Chromatic/prism-autonomy-harness` (Main),
`3D_Meta` (Main), `Chromatic_Skills` (Main), `Viel-Small-Town` (Main), `agentops` (Main),
`04-prism-LAP` (preserve/* branch), plus several `master` repos. See manifest per-repo `action`.

## Security
The PUBLIC harness tracks a **scrubbed** `.claude/settings.json` (no live token found in the
committed copy — `scrub-settings-secrets.py` sanitizes it). The pre-commit gate above is the
safeguard against a future accidental token commit. Separately tracked: the pending
`GH_TOKEN` rotation T4 for `kas1987/claude-config` (leaked `gho_` in history).
